 Description: This program is designed to implement a library search
 engine.  The user has the ability to select from four different
 searches:
 
 • Call number
 • Title
 • Subject
 • Other
 
 The search engine will traverse through the following media types:
 
 • Book
 • Periodical
 • Film
 • Video
 
 and retreive the user's desired results.  For further questions
 please view instructions.  Thank you.
